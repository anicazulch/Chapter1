    // Answers:
    // 1. Yes, it's legal. The lowercase first letter does not make a difference. Might not be the best choice
    //      because it could look like a variable or string
    // 2. Yes, it's legal. Calling it 'SimpleProgram' works and is a good identifier. 
    // 3. No, it's not legal. It kicks an error because a class name cannot start with a number.
    // 4. Yes, it's legal. It works but the underscores seem unnecessary.
    // 5. No, it's not legal. The error says it's an illegal identifier because it cannot start with an asterix. 
    // 6. Yes, it's legal. Although it works, it's not the best name because you can't tell what the program is
    //      or what it's about.
    // 7. No, it's not legal. Because the exclamation point already stands for not-equal in java, it cannot be
    //      used in a class name.
